View CHANGELOG for detailed updates to commit

Known Bugs:

TODO (ordered):
Check to see if everywhere is using the new category system (i.e. as an array)
Update [file] (file browser) to use new sub-categories system ($file_manager['main']->get_subcategories instead of $settings['categories'][$id]['subcategories'])
Check if sorting works
Allow options to change sorting order for files & categorys. (Either custom, or alphabetically)
Run through code and make sure nothing is obsolete

TODO:
Fix awesome XSS exploitatives in Category ids (with recursive ids). In $file_manager['generate_views']->generate_subcategory_html() and dialogs.php
Change class names - Which classes???
Figure out how to get a parent page link to work.
Add "pretty" urls

Localize file uploading, auto attach, and add ability to unatach (if possible)
When changing attachment page, update all current attachments to new page

Possibly add pagination to backend file manager (or, figure out a better way to style File Permissions). Was thinking about moving the Add to Category part to the categories page and just leaving this page for actual file permissions
Figure out how to style File Permissions part of file manager
Figure out how to style File Permissions dialog (add and edit) in regards to categories (or more specifically sub-categories)
