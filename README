Known Bugs:

Need to update help file to explain how to modify the physical layout


TODO (prioratized):
Task 5: Fix $file_manager['update_settings']->validate_settings() delete & update category options
Task 1: Fix sorting categories
Task 2: Allow options to change sorting order for files & categorys. (Either custom, or alphabetically) [application/view/category.php, application/view/options/categories.php]
Task 3: Run through code and make sure nothing is obsolete
Task 4: Fix awesome XSS exploitatives in Category ids (with recursive ids). In $file_manager['generate_views']->generate_categories_admin(), dialogs.php, application/views/category.php

TODO:
Change adding files to categories from the files page to the categories page. 
Chnage class names (i.e. file_manager_update_settings)
Figure out how to get a parent page link to work.
Add "pretty" urls

Localize file uploading, auto attach, and add ability to unatach (if possible)
Localize updating title, description, etc
When changing attachment page, update all current attachments to new page

Possibly add pagination to backend file manager (or, figure out a better way to style File Permissions). Was thinking about moving the Add to Category part to the categories page and just leaving this page for actual file permissions
*Figure out how to style File Permissions part of file manager
*Figure out how to style File Permissions dialog (add and edit) in regards to categories (or more specifically sub-categories)

Possibly add clearing all categories, programs & belts from backend
Make buttons on categories work better (i.e. so it doesn't open the delete dialog when you try and click edit)
